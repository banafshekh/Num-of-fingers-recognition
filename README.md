# Num-of-fingers-recognition
In this program, computer's webcam will be opened and you can take as many picture from your hand with different fingers, as you want.
These pictures will be classified according to the number of opened fingers, so we will have 5 training folders.
For testing, the webcam will be opened another time and if you show you fingers in front of the webcam, it will show you the number.
For example, if you show two fingers, it will show you the number of "2" as the class label.
